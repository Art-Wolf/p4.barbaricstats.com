			<p>The rules of this game hark back to the original Mafia game developed by Dimitry Davidoff pitting the minority informed (the Mafia) and the majority uninformed (the Mob).<p>

			<ol>
				<li>The game is broken into two parts - the Day time and the Night time.</li>
				<li>During the night, the Mafia nominate a player to murder.</li>
				<li>During the day, the mob votes to lynch a player.</li>
				<li>The mob wins when all the mafia players are killed.</li>
				<li>The mafia win when they outnumber the players.</li>
				<li>There are seven players, two will randomly be chosen as the mafia.</li>
